# my_collections
A collection of generics data structures (WIP)

I should archive this repository and create a new one, but since I'm unsure about many things like data structure naming, whether I want to allow a custom allocator, or a custom heuristic instead of the doubling-halving technique, or whether there are better ways to allocate memory, I prefer to wait until I know exactly what I'll be using most. (The thing is, I also tend to write more cpp code because I'm lazy, and cpp can make my life easier if I don't start abusing metaprogramming by creating abstractions I don't even use, which means I don't have much opportunity to test what I need.)
